Extra Credit Option:

Use the IRS tax tables to make a tax calculator. Ask for Filing Status and Adjusted Gross Income and use IF statements to calculate the marginal tax rate.

The rates can be found at http://www.moneychimp.com/features/tax_brackets.htm (Links to an external site.)

For credit, show me how your program works and be prepared to modify it to adjust a tax bracket up or down.
