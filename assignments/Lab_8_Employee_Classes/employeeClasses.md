Begin with the Employee example in the Chapter 8 samples.  There is already a Manager class that is derived from the Employee class.  For this lab:

- Create a new class also derived from the Employee class.  It could be anything from Stormtrooper to Prime Weapon Operator to Waste Compaction Engineer to Sith Lord or whatever you think is best.

- Add at least one appropriate Data Attribute.  (For example, Stormtroopers may need company, platoon, and squad attributes).

- Add at least one appropriate Function or Method.  (For example, Prime Weapon Operator may have a def statement for "DestroyPlanet(self, planet):")

- Demonstrate how you can call the method for your new class and that methods from the Employee class also work.



Or create your own structure using inherited attributes.
