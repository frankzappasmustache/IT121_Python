# ** Lab Description - [Lab 3b - Phone Book Lookup](https://btc.instructure.com/courses/1997047/assignments/20426459)

## * Write a python program that asks for three name and phone number pairs, adding these pairs to a map.  Then ask the user for a name to look up and respond with the phone number for that person.  The prompts should look something like the following:
    * Enter a name:  (the user types the first name)
    * Enter a phone number:  (the user types the first phone number)
    * Enter a name:  (the user types the second name)
    * Enter a phone number:  (the user types the second phone number)
    * Enter a name:  (the user types the third name)
    * Enter a phone number:  (the user types the third phone number)
    * Enter a name to look up:  (the user enters one of the names)
    * The phone number for (the entered name) is (the phone number looked up)

## * For credit run the program for your instructor and describe how it works.  Be prepared to modify it to ask for more or fewer names.

## * For extra credit, add a reverse phone book lookup that asks the user for a phone number and looks up the person who has that number.
