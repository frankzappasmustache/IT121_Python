Move the python commands used to draw three shapes into three functions.  Use a WHILE loop to ask the user three questions.

  "Answer me these questions three, ere a python grade I'll see..."

  "What would you like to draw? (S)quare, (T)riangle, (R)ocket, (Q)uit :"

  "Where would you like to draw it along the X axis?:"

  "Where would you like to draw it along the Y axis?:"

The program should then move the turtle to the appropriate X,Y coordinates and draw the shape.  Then the program should ask the questions again, in an infinite loop, until the user chooses to quit.  If the user chooses to quit, the program should end immediately.

You may vary the shapes drawn and the text of the questions asked.  Actually, you may be as creative as you want as long as the shape-drawing commands are contained in functions and there is a loop involved that lets the user interact with the shape drawing.  (For example, you could ask How Many? or How Big? instead of Where?)  Extra credit for incorporating multiple instructions from the user.  More extra credit if the program hurls the user toward a chasm if they fail to provide proper answers.

For credit show me how the program works and be prepared to modify it.
